I would like to thank my supervisor Wayne Aubrey, for being incredibly supportive of this project, helping me to understand so much more about genetics and biology in general, and giving me lifts to go and meet the researchers, David Bryant and Abhishek Somani, who were also tremendously helpful and patient with all the questions I had.
